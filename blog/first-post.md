# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts here.

## Getting Started

You can write your posts in markdown and they'll be automatically styled to match your personal website.

### Features

- **Markdown support**: Write naturally with markdown syntax
- **Code blocks**: Share code snippets with syntax highlighting
- **Dark mode**: Automatically adapts to your theme preference

Here's an example code block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from my blog!")
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Machine learning and reinforcement learning
2. Computational biology research
3. Building with AI
4. Startup experiences

Stay tuned for more posts!
